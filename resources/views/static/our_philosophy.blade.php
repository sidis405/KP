              <p>
              Kastner&amp;Pallavicino is a Roman luxury label created by Helena Kastner and Virginia Cosentini Pallavicino, in 2015.
              The idea was conceived in a small café in Rome, legendary for its regular clientele of artistic greats from the past. The concept was to create a line of bodies specifically intended as an alternative to a blouse or top. Rich in colors and using fabrics made from silk or velvet, Helena and Virginia realized that this was an essential garment lacking in modern day wardrobes. Ultimately, they designed a collection consisting of twelve bodies and to complete the beauty of the silhouette they created a pair of high wasted trousers, making the perfect blend of elegance and comfort.
              The body in its essence is made to accentuate the sensuality and grace of every woman. Once hidden under shirts or tailleurs, this unique garment has been rediscovered by Kastner&Pallavicino and made into a staple piece for the utmost feminine wardrobe.
              This line is the incarnation of the designer’s polished aesthetics and cultivated taste in apparel. Entirely handmade in Italy, Kastner&amp;Pallavicino work specifically with accomplished tailors and exclusively use fabrics made in the Tuscan region of Italy.

            <p class="blitz">Virginia Cosentini Pallavicino, was born in Rome and raised within an artistic environment, where she developed an intense connection with aesthetics. Growing up between Rome, London and Switzerland, she was exposed to many diverse cultures, and went on to study philosophy to deepen her passion for knowledge. Thus, it is not a coincidence that each model of the bodies is named after an inspirational philosopher. Philosophers focus on the mind, and the bodies are a product of it. Along with her studies in photography, she also worked for a fashion P.R firm in Rome. Virginia has grown her determination to set her own footprints in the fashion business.
